In this research, a movie recommendation system is presented using dependency analysis. Dependency analysis, also called shopping cart analysis, is a data mining technique for determining objects that occur frequently together. For example, in a shopping trip, determining items that are frequently purchased together. This research focuses on a dataset of users' favorite movies. The goal is to discover the dependencies of movies by examining user reviews and then create rules to recommend movies to users with similar interests. The implementation of this system is done using Python in the Jupyter Notebook environment using the MovieLens 100K dataset, which contains 100,000 ratings by 1,000 users on 1,700 movies, and using the Eclat algorithm.
